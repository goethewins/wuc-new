Paxful is a peer to peer money marketplace where you can buy and sell bitcoins direct with other people.

Paxful was built by traders who saw the amazing potential of peer to peer trading to bring bitcoin to the mainstream. Their vision is to nurture the growing cottage industry of pro traders who sell bitcoin into a full blown On Demand economy. On Paxful traders use their bank accounts, paypal accounts, skrill and other financial instruments to exchange value and help get bitcoin into peoples hands.
